## 🧠 About Me

I'm a data scientist with hands-on experience in applied machine learning across multiple sectors from web development to educational tools and forecasting systems.

After exploring a wide range of real-world data projects, I’m now focusing on my **dream career**: becoming a **Clinical Data Scientist and Medical AI Researcher**.

My main interests lie in:
- 🧬 **Oncology** – cancer detection and segmentation  
- 🧠 **Neuroscience** – brain imaging and cognitive disorders  
- 🖼️ **Medical Imaging** – DICOM, 3D image processing, segmentation models

I’m committed to combining data science, research, and medical knowledge to contribute to smarter, more accessible healthcare systems.
